# README #

### Motivation ###
This projec is a programming exercise where it is going to be
implemented a concrete case. The particular aplication is a simple
chess engine. The language to use is "Haskell", like a prototyping
squeme.

* version 0.1.0
the versioning adopted will be the one like (https://semver.org/).

* [Learn Markdown] (https://www.markdowntutorial.com/)

### How to get setup? ###

* Summary of set up:

We will be using the "ghc/ghci" compiler, or "Glascow Haskell
Compiler". Therefore it is recommended to download the "Haskell
Platform". In the future it could be used a building tool like "Cabal".

* Dependencies
The code will be based in the 8.0.2 version of "ghc".

* How the test will be made?
the unit tests will be made using the package "HUnit". In the future
will be configured tests with "QuickCheck".

* Deployment
The target will be to build a standalone binary. This one should be
comunicating with some chess protocol (uci/xboard).
