### Motivation ###
This project is a programming exercise where it is going to be implemented
a concrete case. The particular application is a simple chess engine. The
language to use is "Haskell", like a prototyping scheme.

* version 0.0.10.6
the versioning adopted will be the one like
(https://pvp.haskell.org/).

### How to get setup? ###

* Summary of set up:

We will be using the "ghc/ghci" compiler, or "Glascow Haskell Compiler".
Therefore it is recommended to download the "Haskell Platform". Will be
using "Cabal" as building tool.

* Dependencies
The code will be based in the 8.6.5 version of "ghc".

* How the tests will be made?
The unit tests will be made using the package "HUnit". Also, it will
be tests with "QuickCheck".

* Deployment
The target will be to build a standalone binary. This one should be
communicating with some chess protocol (uci/xboard). That should work on
any machine. I will be versions for windows, MacOS and Linux.
